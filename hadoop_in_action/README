1. There are close() and configure method in both Mapper and Reducer, what are them functions?

/** 
 * Base class for {@link Mapper} and {@link Reducer} implementations.
 * 
 * <p>Provides default no-op implementations for a few methods, most non-trivial
 * applications need to override some of them.</p>
 */
public class MapReduceBase implements Closeable, JobConfigurable {

  /** Default implementation that does nothing. */
 /*It is called when the Mapper or Reducer decounstruter.*/
  public void close() throws IOException {
  }

  /** Default implementation that does nothing. */
 /*It is called when the Mapper or Reducer initialized. Each maper once.*/
  public void configure(JobConf job) {
  }

}
