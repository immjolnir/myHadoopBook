$ man bash
       FIGNORE
              A  colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see READLINE below).  A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in FIG-
              NORE is excluded from the list of matched filenames.  A sample value is ".o:~".
       GLOBIGNORE
              A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of filenames to be ignored by pathname expansion.  If a filename matched by a pathname expansion  pattern  also
              matches one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE, it is removed from the list of matches.
       IGNOREEOF
              Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an EOF character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the number of consecutive EOF characters  which
              must  be  typed as the first characters on an input line before bash exits.  If the variable exists but does not have a numeric value, or has no value, the default
              value is 10.  If it does not exist, EOF signifies the end of input to the shell.

       Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the list of matching words.  If a compspec is not found, the default bash completion as described above under  Com-
       pleting is performed.

       First,  the  actions  specified by the compspec are used.  Only matches which are prefixed by the word being completed are returned.  When the -f or -d option is used for
       filename or directory name completion, the shell variable FIGNORE is used to filter the matches.

       Any completions specified by a pathname expansion pattern to the -G option are generated next.  The words generated by the pattern need not  match  the  word  being  com-
       pleted.  The GLOBIGNORE shell variable is not used to filter the matches, but the FIGNORE variable is used
