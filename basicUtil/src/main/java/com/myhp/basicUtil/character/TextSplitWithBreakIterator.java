 * {@code Locale} http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html
 * A Locale object represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural region.
 * An operation that requires a Locale to perform its task is called locale-sensitive and uses the Locale to tailor information for the user.
 * For example, displaying a number is a locale-sensitive operationâ€” the number
 * should be formatted according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country, region, or culture.
 * <p/>

 * {@code BreakIterator} http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/BreakIterator.html
 * The BreakIterator class implements methods for finding the location of boundaries in text.
 * Instances of BreakIterator maintain a current position and scan over text returning the index of characters where boundaries occur.
 * Internally, BreakIterator scans text using a CharacterIterator, and is thus able to scan text held by
 * any object implementing that protocol.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * A StringCharacterIterator is used to scan String objects passed to setText.
 * You use the factory methods provided by this class to create instances of various types of break iterators.
 * In particular, use getWordIterator, getLineIterator, getSentenceIterator, and getCharacterIterator to create BreakIterators that
 * perform word, line, sentence, and character boundary analysis respectively.
 * A single BreakIterator can work only on one unit (word, line, sentence, and so on).
 * You must use a different iterator for each unit boundary analysis you wish to perform.
 * getCharacterInstance()
 * getLineInstance()
 * getSentenceInstance()
 * getWordInstance()
 * <p/>
 * BreakIterator.DONE is distinct with CharacterIterator.DONE, because it not the sub-class of CharacterIterator.
 *
 * DONE is returned by previous(), next(), next(int), preceding(int)
 * and following(int) when either the first or last text boundary has been
 * reached.
 * public static final int DONE = -1;
