Following is the general set of practices we prescribe for TEs:
	* Test planning and risk analysis
	* Review specs, designs, code, and existing tests
	* Exploratory testing
	* User scenarios
	* Test case creation
	* Executing test cases
	* Crowd sourcing
	* User feedback
Of course, TEs with a strong personalityand excellent communication skills are the onse who do all these things to maximum impact.

Here are some features we want in a test plan:

* It is always up to date.
* It describes the intent of the software and why it will be loved by its users.
* It contains a snapshot of how the software is structured and the names of the various components and features.
* It describes what the software should do and summaries how it will do it.

But, 
* It cannot take long to create and must be readily modifiable.
* It should describe what must be tested.
* It should be useful during testing to help determine progress and coverage gaps.
