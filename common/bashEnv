 If the extglob shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin, several extended pattern matching operators are recognized.  In the follow‐
       ing  description, a pattern-list is a list of one or more patterns separated by a |.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of
       the following sub-patterns:

              ?(pattern-list)
                     Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
              *(pattern-list)
                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
              +(pattern-list)
                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
              @(pattern-list)
                     Matches one of the given patterns
              !(pattern-list)
                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns
